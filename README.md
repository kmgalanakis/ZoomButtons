# ZoomButtons

Inpsired by [this](https://www.instructables.com/Zoom-Control-Box) and [this](https://www.instructables.com/USB-Volume-Control-and-Caps-Lock-LED-Simple-Cheap-) Instructables, the code is heavily modified though.

## Installation

Quoting from the actual Instructable:

> From the drop-down menu items at the top of the Arduino, select Tools - Manage Libraries...
>
> In the search box type HID-Project and press Enter. When HID-Project by NicoHood appears, click the Install button. You can now close the Library Manager.
>
> From the drop-down menus, select Tools - Board - SparkFun AVR Boards and select SparkFun Pro Micro.
>
> If you don't see SparkFun AVR Boards, select Boards Manager instead. This looks very much like the Libraries Manager. Search for Sparkfun AVR Boards and install it. You can now select the SparkFun Pro Micro as above.
>
> Under the Tools menu it should now say Board: Sparkfun Pro Micro. Hover your mouse over the Processor line beneath and select ATmega32U4 (5V, 16MHz) if it's not already selected.
>
> Just beneath Processor, select Port and note which Serial ports (if any) are listed.
